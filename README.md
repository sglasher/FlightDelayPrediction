-- Project Status: Completed

## Installation ##
To begin using this project clone the repo using the instructions from below. Once cloned you'll need to update the path to the CSV in the Python code in order to get it to run as the location will vary based on the local machine.

` git init `

` git clone https://github.com/sglasher/MSAAI500.git`

` pip install airportsdata `
` pip install meteostat `

## Project Intro/Objective ##
The goal of this project was to take flight data from August 2018 and deploy 4 models to determine which is best at predicting flight delays and with which set of features. Features had to be removed via EDA to determine which were going to have the most effect on the models when predicting delay. Some features were added, such as Day of Week and Weather Information for Origin and Destination, to determine their importance in determining delay.
